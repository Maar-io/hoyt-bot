# Security Considerations for HOYT Bot

## Overview

HOYT Bot interacts with DeFi protocols and manages funds on both Arbitrum and Hyperliquid. This document outlines important security considerations when using this software.

## Risk Factors

### Smart Contract Risks

- **Uniswap Protocol**: HOYT Bot relies on Uniswap v3 for LP positions. Smart contract vulnerabilities in Uniswap could affect your funds.
- **Token Contracts**: The PENDLE and USDT token contracts could contain vulnerabilities.
- **Bridging Risks**: Arbitrum is an L2 solution that relies on Ethereum L1 for ultimate security. Bridge issues could affect fund withdrawal.

### Oracle & Price Manipulation Risks

- **Price Manipulation**: Large market movements could cause impermanent loss in LP positions that the hedging strategy might not fully mitigate.
- **Oracle Failures**: The bot relies on price data from both Uniswap and Hyperliquid. Oracle manipulation or failure could lead to incorrect hedging.

### API & Connection Risks

- **Hyperliquid API**: The bot relies on the Hyperliquid API for hedge positioning. API downtime could prevent proper hedging.
- **RPC Node Reliability**: The bot requires a reliable Arbitrum RPC node. Node downtime could prevent LP position monitoring.

### Private Key Management

- **API Key Security**: Your Hyperliquid API key provides access to your exchange account. Compromise could lead to unauthorized trades.
- **Wallet Private Key**: If provided, your Ethereum private key must be kept secure. Compromise would allow theft of all assets.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small amounts to test the bot's performance and your configuration.
2. **Secure Environment**: Run the bot in a secure, isolated environment with limited access.
3. **Key Management**: Use environment variables or secure vaults for API keys and private keys.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Check the bot's performance and positions regularly.
5. **Set Reasonable Thresholds**: Configure appropriate rebalance and funding rate thresholds for your risk tolerance.

## Configuration Security

1. Never hardcode private keys or API keys in source code
2. Secure your `.env` file with appropriate permissions (600)
3. When using Docker, use Docker secrets for sensitive information
4. Consider using a dedicated node for secure RPC access

## Emergency Shutdown

If you need to stop the bot urgently:

1. Use `Ctrl+C` if running in terminal, or
2. Run `docker-compose down` if using Docker, or
3. Use `kill -15 <PID>` if running as a background process

Alternatively, you can manually close your positions on Hyperliquid if needed.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities in HOYT Bot:

1. DO NOT disclose the issue publicly
2. Create a private issue report with detailed information
3. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure
